GRAMMAR

An expression is one of: an atom, a pair, a list, a method call, or a block.

Atom

An atom is one of: a number, a boolean, #nil, or a string.
Examples: 13, 0x13, -45.67, #true, sam, "This is a string"

The evaluated value of an atom is itself, with the the exception of strings, which evaluate to the value bound to the string in the environment.

Pair

A pair is a left paren ('('), an expression, a comma (','), an expression, and a right paren (')').
Example: (1, 2)

The evaluated value of a pair is a pair of the evaluated values of each of its constituents.

List

A list is a left paren ('('), followed by 0 or more expressions, separated by spaces, and a right paren (')').
Example: (this is a list)

The evaluated value if a list is a list of the evaluated values of each of its constituents.

Method call

A method call is a left square bracket ('['), followed by interleaved expressions and selectors, separated by spaces, followed by a right square bracket (']').
Example: [1 add: 2]

The evaluated value of a method call is the result of calling the given method with the given arguments.

Block

A block is a left brace ('{'), followed by a list, followed by a sequence of expressions, separated by spaces, followed by a right brace ('}').
Example: {(a b) [a add: b]}

The evaluated value of a block is itself.

Short forms

'x        is short for [x quote]
[x = y]   is short for [#Environment at: 'x put: y]
[x := y]  is short for [#Environment new: 'x put: y]
x.y       is short for [x at: 'y]
[x.y = z] is short for [x at: 'y put: z]

For more examples, see the module "point.ool".

TODO

Bugs

Features
- Macros; perhaps {{<macro-name> <macro-arg-1> ... <macro-arg-N>}}

Enhancements
- Blocks with no arguments; evalled as a sequence of exprs by "eval"
- Use readline for interactive input
- Perhaps generalization of dotted-string?  @xxx.yyy.zzz, where '@' introduces string,
  white space terminates it, and subunits (which can be arbitrary characters, i.e. arbitrary expressions)
  are separated by periods?  Or xxx@yyy@zzz?
- Scoped instance vars and methods; private, protected, public
- Read only object attributes vs. acessor methods?

Gotchas?
- break can operate across block boundaries

Optimizations
- Make m_xxx functions return a value, too
- Better internal representations
  - Blocks: separate args and body
- Memory management
  - Keep freed blocks in lists ordered by size, for re-use
  - Instead of freeing instances (objects), keep a list of free instances
    linked off the class; garbage collection frees them first
    - How deal with objs with additional storage, eg. strings, arrays?
- Simplify scanner

Etc.
- Finalize socket and math modules
- Additional modules
