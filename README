GRAMMAR

An expression is one of: an atom, a pair, a list, a method call, or a block.

An atom is one of: a number, a symbol or a string.
Examples: 13, 0x13, -45.67, sam, "This is a string"

A pair is a left paren ('('), an expression, a comma (','), an expression, and a right paren (')').
Example: (1, 2)

A list is a left paren ('('), followed by 0 or more expressions, separated by spaces, and a right paren (')').
Example: (this is a list)

A method call is a left square bracket ('['), followed by interleaved expressions and selectors, separated by spaces, followed by a right square bracket (']').
Example: [1 add: 2]

A block is a left brace ('{'), followed by a list, followed by a sequence of expressions, separated by spaces, followed by a right brace ('}').
Example: {(a b) [a add: b]}

Short forms

'x        is short for [x quote]
[x = y]   is short for [#Environment at: 'x put: y]
[x := y]  is short for [#Environment new: 'x put: y]
x.y       is short for [x at: 'y]
[x.y = z] is short for [x at: 'y put: z]

For more examples, see the module "point.ool".

TODO

Bugs

Features
- while, return

Enhancements
- Perhaps generalization of dotted-string?  @xxx.yyy.zzz, where '@' introduces string,
  white space terminates it, and subunits (which can be arbitrary characters, i.e. arbitrary expressions)
  are separated by periods?  Or xxx@yyy@zzz?
- Scoped instance vars and methods; private, protected, public
- Read only object attributes vs. acessor methods?

Optimizations
- Make m_xxx functions return a value, too
