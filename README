DESIGN GOALS

Minimalism
Regularity
Everything is a first-class object
Functional programming
Borrowing
- Smalltalk: method invocation style
- Lisp: lists, car and cdr, NIL
- C++: comments
- FORTH: prompt

ARCHITECTURE

Lightweight virtual machine

Infrastructure

TODO

Features
- Modules

Enhancements
- Perhaps generalization of dotted-string?  @xxx.yyy.zzz, where '@' introduces string,
  white space terminates it, and subunits (which can be arbitrary characters, i.e. arbitrary expressions)
  are separated by periods?  Or xxx@yyy@zzz?
- Scoped instance vars and methods; private, protected, public
- Read only object attributes vs. acessor methods?

Optimizations
- Make m_xxx functions return a value, too
