Features

Enhancements
- Perhaps generalization of dotted-string?  @xxx.yyy.zzz, where '@' introduces string,
  white space terminates it, and subunits (which can be arbitrary characters, i.e. arbitrary expressions)
  are separated by periods?  Or xxx@yyy@zzz?
- Scoped instance vars and methods; private, protected, public
- Read only object attributes vs. acessor methods?

Optimizations
- Make m_xxx functions return a value, too
